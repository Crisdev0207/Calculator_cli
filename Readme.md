# Basic Calculator

This is a simple Python program that simulates a basic calculator. It allows the user to perform four basic arithmetic operations:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

## How It Works

The program prompts the user to choose one of the four operations and then asks for two numbers as input. Depending on the chosen operation, it will output the result of applying that operation to the two numbers.

### Steps:

1. The user is presented with a menu to select the desired operation:
   - `1. Addition`
   - `2. Subtraction`
   - `3. Multiplication`
   - `4. Division`

2. The user inputs their choice (1, 2, 3, or 4).

3. The program asks for two numbers to perform the selected operation.

4. The program outputs the result:
   - If the user chooses `Addition`, it will add the two numbers.
   - If the user chooses `Subtraction`, it will subtract the second number from the first.
   - If the user chooses `Multiplication`, it will multiply the two numbers.
   - If the user chooses `Division`, it will divide the first number by the second, but will return an error if the second number is `0`.
